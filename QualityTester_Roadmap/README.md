:crystal_ball: I encourage any QA Engineer to ensure that above is wrapped up before starting with automation, as i would say that the main key feature for automation is to `Document Manually Written Test Cases`  and `Engineering` it in a way the code will be `readable` `understandable` and `reusable`.
